# willsono

A submission to a William Sonoma coding challenge. 

Given a JSON file with an input of products designed a page that meets these criteria:
* Consumes the JSON of products
* Builds the product details page with all products
* Displays the product details, including price, product name and the main hero image
* Interacts intuitivley; if you click on the image, you should see an overlay with a carousal of all thumbnail images

Additionally I built a responsive experience where it is 1 column for mobile and 3 for desktop. Also took extra care to make the page completely accessible by keyboard and eliminated all tab traps. Added a sorting options at the top that sorts by alphabet, highest price and lowest price. Built this all in pure vanilla javascript with no frameworks.
